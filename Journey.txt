Well today I'm not feeling good, so I decided to pick a simple challenge, and try to finish it in less than 
a hour since is too easy.
At the first look, I guess I won't bother myself by using grid layout, I will just go for flexbox layout!
Here we go!

Challenge done at 7:20 P.M 

I hope one day I'll get better at this :D
